    "# M4 | Research Investigation Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will do a research investigation of your chosen dataset in teams. You will begin by formally selecting your research question (task 0), then processing your data (task 1), creating a predictive model (task 2), evaluating your model's results (task 3), and describing the contributions of each team member (task 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "For grading, please make sure your notebook has all cells run and is stored in your team's [Github Classroom repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/CNxME27U). You will also need to write a short, 2 page report about your design decisions as a team, to be stored in your repository. The Milestone 4 submission will be the contents of your repository at the due date (April 28 at 23:59 CET).\n",

    "## Brief overview of Calcularis\n",
    "[Calcularis](https://school.alemira.com/de/calcularis/) by Alemira School is a mathematics learning program developed with neuroscientists and computer scientists from ETH Zurich. It promotes the development and interaction of the different areas of the brain that are responsible for processing numbers and quantities and solving mathematical tasks. Calcularis can be used from 1st grade to high school. Children with dyscalculia also benefit in the long term and overcome their arithmetic weakness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Calcularis dataset has three main tables:\n",
    "* ***users***: meta information about users (i.e. total time spent learning with Calcularis, geographic location).\n",
    "* ***events***: events done by the users in the platform (i.e. playing a game, selecting a new animal in the zoo simulation).\n",
    "* ***subtasks***: sub-tasks with answer attempts solved by users, primarily in the context of game events.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tables and useful metadata information are described in detail in the [Milestone 2 data exploration notebook](https://github.com/epfl-ml4ed/mlbd-2023/blob/main/project/milestone-02/m2_calcularis_sciper.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided access to the [full dataset](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=88179) (~65k users) and a randomly selected subset (~1k users from M2). We have also provided access to a [test account to experiment with Calcularis](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=88094). You should provide arguments and justifications for all of your design decisions throughout this investigation. You can use your M3 responses as the basis for this discussion."
