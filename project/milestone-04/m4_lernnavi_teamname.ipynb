    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will do a research investigation of your chosen dataset in teams. You will begin by formally selecting your research question (task 0), then processing your data (task 1), creating a predictive model (task 2), evaluating your model's results (task 3), and describing the contributions of each team member (task 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "For grading, please make sure your notebook has all cells run and is stored in your team's [Github Classroom repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/CNxME27U). You will also need to write a short, 2 page report about your design decisions as a team, to be stored in your repository. The Milestone 4 submission will be the contents of your repository at the due date (April 28 at 23:59 CET).\n",
